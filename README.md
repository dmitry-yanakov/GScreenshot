## ✨ Why GScreenshot?
Most online screenshot tools store your images on their own servers before giving you a link. **GScreenshot works differently**:
- **No Middleman:** Your images never touch our servers.
- **Direct Upload:** Files are sent straight from your browser to your personal Google Drive.
- **Total Privacy:** You own your data. Your drive, your rules.

## 🛠 Features
- ✏️ **Editing Suite:** Pencil, lines, arrows, and shapes (rectangles).
- 💬 **Annotations:** Add text comments directly onto your screenshots.
- 🌫 **Privacy Blur:** Easily blur sensitive information before saving.
- 📂 **Auto-Organization:** Automatically creates a dedicated folder in your Google Drive.
- 🌍 **Multi-language Support:** Available in English, Ukrainian, and Russian.
- 🎨 **Modern UI:** Clean, dark-themed interface with glassmorphism effects.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Capture/Upload:** Paste an image or upload a file.
2. **Edit:** Use the built-in tools to highlight or hide details.
3. **Save:** Click "Upload" to securely transfer the file to Google Drive via official API.
